# Movie Streaming Database Project

This is a backend simulation of a **Movie Streaming Platform** built with **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**.  
This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Database** course.

---

## Overview

This API simulates the backend of a **movie streaming service**, allowing users to:

-  Manage movies, users, reviews, and watch history.  
- Perform **keyword-based** and **hybrid (semantic + keyword)** movie searches.  
- Retrieve reviews and ratings for any movie.  
- View user-specific watch histories.  
- Fetch **top-watched movies** from recent activity (last 30 days).  

The data is initialized using Python scripts that populate MongoDB with realistic sample datasets.

---

## Setup & Installation

###  1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+** ‚Üí [Download Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
- **MongoDB Community Server** ‚Üí [Download Here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

> Ensure your MongoDB service is running locally at:  
> **mongodb://localhost:27017/**

---

###  2. Install Required Dependencies
Open your terminal and install dependencies via pip:

pip install fastapi pymongo bson uvicorn

---

###  3. Database Initialization

Run these scripts in order to populate your MongoDB database with initial and extended datasets:

python main.py
python add_more_data.py
python more_watch_history2.py

**main.py** ‚Üí creates the core collections (Movies, Users, Reviews, WatchHistory).
**add_more_data.py** ‚Üí adds more movies, users, and reviews.
**more_watch_history2.py** ‚Üí generates additional watch history and simulates recent trending movies

---

### 4. Run the API Server

Start the FastAPI server locally using Uvicorn:

**python -m uvicorn appfinal:app --reload**


Once the server starts, open your browser or Postman and visit:

http://127.0.0.1:8000


You should see the message:

**üé¨ Movie Streaming API is running!**

---

## üß† Core Features
**1. Movie Management**

View and search all movies in the database.

Text search by title, director, or cast name.

**2. Hybrid Search System**

Combines semantic similarity (via SequenceMatcher) and text indexing results.

Uses Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for combined ranking, giving smarter search results.

**3. Movie Reviews**

Retrieve all reviews for a specific movie.

Each review includes the user name, rating, and review text.

**4. User Watch History**

Fetch full watch history for any user by ID.

Each record shows movie details, duration watched, and timestamp.

**5. Top Watched Movies**

Dynamically identifies and returns the most-watched movies from the last 30 days.

## API Endpoints

| **Method** | **Endpoint** | **Description** |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **GET** | `/` | Root route ‚Äî confirms the API is running |
| **GET** | `/movies/search/keyword?query=<term>` | Search movies by keyword (title, director, or cast) |
| **GET** | `/movies/search/hybrid?query=<term>` | Perform hybrid (semantic + keyword) search |
| **GET** | `/movies/{movie_id}/reviews` | Fetch all reviews for a specific movie |
| **GET** | `/users/{user_id}/history` | Fetch the watch history of a specific user |
| **GET** | `/movies/top-watched` | Retrieve top-watched movies from the last 30 days |

---

## Database Design

**Database Name:** `MovieStreamingDB_NewFinal`

The database follows a **NoSQL document structure** using **MongoDB**, consisting of four main collections ‚Äî each designed to handle different aspects of the movie streaming platform.

---

### Movies Collection

Stores all movie-related data including metadata, cast, and calculated embeddings for semantic search.

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| `_id` | ObjectId | Unique identifier for each movie |
| `title` | String | Movie title |
| `release_year` | Integer | Year the movie was released |
| `genres` | Array\<String> | List of genres associated with the movie |
| `cast` | Array\<Document> | Each object includes `{ name: String, role: String }` |
| `director` | String | Director of the movie |
| `rating` | Float | Average movie rating |
| `embedding` | Array\<Float> | Vector representation for hybrid search and similarity matching |

---

### Users Collection

Stores registered user details and subscription information.

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| `_id` | ObjectId | Unique identifier for each user |
| `name` | String | User‚Äôs full name |
| `email` | String | User‚Äôs email address |
| `subscription_type` | String | Subscription type (e.g., Basic, Premium) |

---

### üìù Reviews Collection

Stores user-generated reviews linked to both users and movies.

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| `_id` | ObjectId | Unique identifier for each review |
| `user_id` | ObjectId | References the user who wrote the review |
| `movie_id` | ObjectId | References the movie being reviewed |
| `rating` | Float | Rating given by the user |
| `review_text` | String | Written review content |

---

### WatchHistory Collection

Tracks every movie watched by users, including timestamps and durations.

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| `_id` | ObjectId | Unique identifier for each watch record |
| `user_id` | ObjectId | References the user who watched the movie |
| `movie_id` | ObjectId | References the movie that was watched |
| `timestamp` | DateTime | Date and time the movie was watched |
| `watch_duration` | Integer | Duration (in minutes) of the movie watched |

---

### Indexes Implemented

To enhance performance and search efficiency, the following indexes are defined:

| **Collection** | **Field(s)** | **Index Type** | **Purpose** |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Movies** | `title`, `director`, `cast.name` | **Text Index** | Enables text-based and hybrid movie search |
| **WatchHistory** | `movie_id` | **Single-field Index** | Speeds up fetching of user watch history and top-watched movies |
| **Reviews** | `movie_id` | **Single-field Index** | Optimizes queries for fetching reviews of specific movies |
