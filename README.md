# MovieStreamingProject
Movie streaming API project for Advance Database

## üìñ Overview  
This project simulates a **Movie Streaming Platform backend** using **Flask** and **MongoDB**.  
It provides an API to:  
- Manage users, movies, reviews, and watch history.  
- Perform a hybrid movie search combining similarity matching, ratings, and popularity.  
- Fetch user watch history and movie reviews dynamically from the database.  

The dataset is initialized in `main.py`, and the API logic runs in `appfinal.py`. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Required Installs / Setup Instructions
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

### üß© 1. Python
- **Version:** 3.8 or above  
- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

---

### üß∞ 2. MongoDB
- Install and start **MongoDB Community Server**  
- [Download MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- Make sure your MongoDB service is running locally at: mongodb://localhost:27017/

---

### üì¶ 3. Required Python Libraries
Install all required dependencies using **pip**:
pip install flask pymongo bson

---

### üöÄ 4. How to Run the Project
-Populate the MongoDB database by running:
python main.py 

-Start the Flask API server by running:
python appfinal.py

-Open your browser or API testing tool (like Postman) and go to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

-You should see the message:
üé¨ **Movie Streaming API is running!**

The API is now live and ready for use. You can test routes such as:

-GET /users/<user_id>/history ‚Üí **Fetch a user's watch history**

-GET /movies/<movie_id>/reviews ‚Üí **Get reviews for a specific movie**

-GET /movies/search?query=<movie_name> ‚Üí **Search for movies by title, director, or cast**

## üß† Technical Aspects

**Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL)

**Backend Framework:** Flask

**APIs:** RESTful APIs using Flask routes

**Data Handling:** PyMongo for MongoDB queries

**Similarity Algorithm:** SequenceMatcher from difflib for hybrid movie search

**Indexes:**

Text index on title, director, and cast.name in the Movies collection

Single-field index on movie_id in the WatchHistory collection

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The dataset is manually initialized in main.py and consists of:

**Movies Collection:** 10 movies with genres, cast, directors, and ratings

**Users Collection:** 10 users with name, email, and subscription type

**Reviews Collection:** Reviews for each movie, linked by user and movie IDs

**WatchHistory Collection:** User watch history with timestamps and durations
